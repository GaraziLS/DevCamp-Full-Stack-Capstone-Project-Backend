## Adding extra layers of security

We need to add an extra layer of security, because storing plain passwords in the database isn't safe. That's why password hashes are used, as a substitute to the actual passwords. We'll also implement other security measures thanks to a library called Flask Login. This will manage logins and log outs, among other things.

```
pip install flask-login
```
Now we'll import the library, and its main component, the Login Manager:

```
from flask_login import LoginManager
login_manager = LoginManager()
```

The login manager contains the code that lets your application and Flask-Login work together, such as how to load a user from an ID, where to send users when they need to log in, and the like. Once the actual application object has been created, you can configure it for login with:

```
login_manager.init_app(app)
```

Flask Login works with sessions and secret keys. [Here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/quickstart/#sessions) is more info.

So we'll first generate a secret key (I'm storing this in a separate file). Use the following command to quickly generate a value for Flask.secret_key (or SECRET_KEY):
